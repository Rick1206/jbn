Forever Love Children Center</h1>

<strong class="fb">March, 2012</strong>


<ul class="ol-decimal fb">
<li>
Forever Love Children Center (hereinafter referred as this Home) is a non-profitable organization initiated by local citizens in Shanghai, with the purposes to care for needed orphans.   
 </li>
<li>
China has entered into a fast economic growth stage. Many young parents have strong financial burdens and are very busy at work. They pay no attention to health knowledge during pregnancy and make wrong decisions when they see their babies with health problems. There are hundreds of thousands babies abandoned and sent to the government-run orphanages each year. As a blessing channel of many individuals, non-profit organizations, and corporates,  this Home will work with government-run orphanages to share their burdens and to give orphans a bright future.
</li>
<li>
The main objective of this Home is to provide timely medication help and care for children with health problems. If they are treated at an early age, many can be completely healed.
</li>
<li>
In addition to physical needs, this Home also cares for the mental health of each child, whose inner mind and soul need to be touched by love. Therefore, this Home emphasizes providing an atmosphere with family love, where each child will be cared according to their individual physical needs and personalities as well. This Home hopes each child will not only grow strongly both physical and mental, but also grows with strong characters that lead them to an abundant life.
</li>
<li>
This Home believes that the true value of a person is not outside but inside. We will thus educate children with this value system and help them to achieve a beautiful life and be a blessing to the country regardless of their outward physical limitations.
</li>
<li>
All orphans of this Home come from government-run orphanages in various cities in China via authorized caring agreements. For those who are interested in adoptions, please apply through the official channels set up by the China government.
</li>
